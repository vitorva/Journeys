***Journeys*** is a web application made for trips creation using **experience-based Points of Interest** (POIs) around Switzerland üá®üá≠ (but don't worry, more countries will come soon üåç)

Users will be able to :

- Plan places they want to discover (at the local, cantonal or national scale) as trips, visualize and organize them as they go.
- Share their own stories by uploading pictures and redacting experiences.
- Journal their trip using our friendly dashboard and keep amazing memories forever !

Our web app is now available at [www.myjourneys.ch](https://www.myjourneys.ch) !
